Customizing the Command Line Prompt
The default command line prompt is $ for normal users and # for the root or superuser.

Customizing the command line prompt is as simple as modifying the value of the environment variable PS1. For example, to set it to display the hostname, user and current directory:

12
$ PS1="\h:\u:\w>"
c7:coop:/tmp>
Besides the aesthetic value of having a prettier prompt than the default value, embedding more information in the prompt can be quite useful. In the example given we have shown:

The machine name - this is useful if you run command line windows on remote machines from your desktop; you can always tell where you are, and this can avoid many errors.

The user name - this is particularly important if you are running as a superuser (root) and can help you avoid errors where you take what you think is a benign action and wind up crippling your system.

The current directory - it is always important to know where you are. You certainly do not want to do something like rm * in the wrong directory.

Here is a table with some of the possible special characters that can be embedded in the PS1 string:
