https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/38175/difference-between-login-shell-and-non-login-shell

Any command shell can be invoked merely by typing its name at the command line. A user’s default shell can be changed with the chsh utility.

We will concentrate on bash, which is generally the default shell under Linux.

Kinds of shells
A login shell is one requiring a password (logging in)

An interactive shell is one in which the standard input/output streams are connected to terminals

A non-interactive shell is one in which the standard input/output streams may be connected to a process, etc.

Initialization
Interactive shells
Login shells:

if /etc/profile exists, source it

if ~/.bash_profile exists, source it

else if ~/.bash_login exists, source it 

else if ~/.profile exists, source it

on exit, if ~/.bash_logout exists, source it

Non-login shells:

if ~/.bashrc exists, source it

Non-interactive shells
Despite what the man page says, it seems to be the same as interactive shells.

Note that by default, most distributions include a system-wide file (usually /etc/bashrc) from the user’s ~/.bashrc.
