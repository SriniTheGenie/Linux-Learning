If you just want to create a file, without even doing an editor, there are two standard ways to just create one from the command line and fill it with content.

The first is to just use echo repeatedly:

123
$ echo line one > myfile
$ echo line two >> myfile
$ echo line three >> myfile
This sort of game is often played from scripts.

A second way is to use cat combined with redirection:

12345
$ cat  << EOF > myfile
> line one
> line two
> line three
> EOF $
either of which produces a file which has in it:

123
line one
line two
line three
