info
info is a simple-to-use documentation system, hypertextual in nature, although it does not require a graphical browser. The documentation is built using the Texinfo system, which is a reader you need know nothing about.

You may have noticed that many man pages say you can get more detailed information by running info on the command, such as in:

1
$ info ls
This pops you into a documentation page, which you can page through by hitting the space bar. Other key bindings are:

Key

Function

n

Go to next node

p

Go to previous node

u

Go to upper node

l

Go to last visited node

space or PageDown

Go to next page

delete\verb or backspace or PageUp

Go to previous page

/ or CTL-s

Search for the string prompted for

i

Search for a node containing the string prompted for

You will notice we distinguish between nodes and pages. The info page is a hierarchical tree of nodes, each of which may have multiple pages, or screenfuls.


Lines which begin with an asterisk (*) are nodes which you can jump to by moving to that line (with the arrow keys for example) and then hitting return.

info is easier to use than it is to describe. It often contains more exhaustive information than the man page, but  sometimes it just regurgitates it.
