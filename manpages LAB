Multiple man Pages (Lab)
Often, there are multiple man pages (in different chapters of the manual) for a given topic. As an example, we will give stat.

If you just do:

1234567891011121314
$ man stat
STAT(1)                          User Commands                        STAT(1)

NAME
      stat - display file or file system status

SYNOPSIS
      stat [OPTION] FILE...

DESCRIPTION

you will get a description of the command line utility.

Try doing:

1
$ man -k stat
which is equivalent to doing apropos stat. You will get a long list of man pages that reference the string stat.

 To narrow the list down to pages that are an exact match, do:

1
$ man -f stat
and then you can get the page from chapter two by doing:

1
$ man 2 stat
If you want to see all the pages, you can do:

1
$ man -a stat
and then you can see each of the relevant chapters in turn, typing q after each one is displayed to proceed the next one.
