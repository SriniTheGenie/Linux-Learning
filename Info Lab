Using info (Lab)
Enter the info help system for gcc by doing:

1
$ info gcc
If you type ? (or H, depending on the info version), a screen will be brought up detailing the various key bindings and commands you can type.

For example, suppose you want to examine optimization levels that can be invoked. You can search forward either by hitting / or s and typing in the string optimization.

Navigate around to different levels, search for other items and familiarize yourself with the info system.
