Environment Variables
Environment variables are not limited in length or number. Lots of applications use them, for instance, in order to set default values for configuration options.

Examples include HOME, HOST, PATH, and can be set as in PATH: PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH for example.

Note: Putting ./ in your path is a security risk; an unfriendly user might substitute an executable which could be quite harmful. However, if you are on a single user system, you may want to violate this recommendation.

Type env (or export) to get a list of presently exported environment variables, set to get the complete set of variables.

Some variables to set (use whatever values make sense for you!):

123456
EDITOR=/usr/bin/emacs
CD_PATH=$HOME:/tmp
LS_COLORS="......"
PAGER=/usr/bin/less
HISTSIZE=1000

An environment variable must be exported to propagate its value to a child process. You can do either of the following:

12
$ VAR=value ; export VAR
$ export VAR=value
You can also make one or more environment variables take effect for just one command:

1
$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD DEBUG=3 ./foobar
